===================== Logistics =================================


- Tracking and Status Updates: Enable real-time tracking of shipments using unique tracking numbers. Participants should be able to update the status of shipments as they progress through different stages, such as "in transit," "arrived," "delivered," or "delayed."
- Document Management: Provide a way to upload, store, and manage important documents related to each shipment, such as bills of lading, customs clearance documents, invoices, and other required paperwork.
- Shipment Creation: Allow participants to create new shipments by providing necessary details such as shipment ID, origin, destination, and other relevant information.

enum ShipmentStatus { InTransit, Arrived, Delivered }
    struct Document {
        uint256 documentId;
        string documentType;
        string documentName;
        string documentHash;
    }
=> Shipment Details:-
        uint256 shipmentId;
        address origin;
        address destination;
        uint256 arrivalDate;
        ShipmentStatus status;
        mapping(uint256 => Document) documents;  // Mapping of document ID to Document struct





- Automated Notifications: Implement automated notifications or event triggers to alert relevant parties about shipment milestones, delays, or critical updates.

- Integration with External Systems: Consider integrating your smart contract with external systems or APIs, such as tracking services or customs databases, to enhance data accuracy and streamline information exchange.


Tracking and Status Updates:
Each shipment can be represented by a struct that includes fields such as shipment ID, origin, destination, current status, and tracking number.
Participants can update the status of shipments by calling a function in the smart contract and providing the shipment ID and the new status.
You can include different stages as enumerated values, such as "InTransit," "Arrived," "Delivered," or "Delayed," to represent the progress of the shipment.
Document Management:
Create a separate struct to represent documents associated with each shipment, including fields like document ID, document type, document name, and document hash (to ensure integrity).
Implement functions to upload, store, and manage documents by associating them with the corresponding shipment.
Consider using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) or a similar decentralized storage system to store the actual documents or their hashes in the contract.
Shipment Creation:
Participants can create new shipments by calling a function and providing the necessary details such as shipment ID, origin, destination, and any other relevant information.
The smart contract should store this information and assign a unique tracking number to the new shipment.
Consider implementing access controls to ensure only authorized participants can create shipments.
